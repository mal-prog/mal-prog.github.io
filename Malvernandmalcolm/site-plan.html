      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>“Hi” my name is Malcolm, and I am a full stack web developer and working for Malvern Fashions a fashion tailoring company in Bulawayo Zimbabwe. I am planning to create a website for it and this makes the company to be marketable to all customers so as for them to able to make orders and payments without having to endure transports costs. To attract more customers, for every first Friday of the month have a black Friday sale where products will have a 20% discount as this attracts more customers and increase the company's marketability ” Would you be willing to meet with me next week for an official interview?”</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Business executives need high-quality, professional clothing that is stylish and unique. Such customers will be willing to pay more for this extra service and they often need clothing that is appropriate for their profession. A tailor can help create clothing that meets both requirements and can choose fabrics and methods that makes the clothes last longer than something that is purchased at a store. In addition, many executives like to have unique styles that set them apart from the rest of the crowd. A tailor can help create a look that is personal and professional at the same time</p>  <!-- change this -->
